Task 3: To build a basic calculator with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I created an interactive interface featuring buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator includes a display screen to show both user inputs and results. I used the CSS grid system to arrange the buttons and implemented event listeners, conditional statements, operators, and loops to process user inputs and perform calculations. This project is suitable for those with foundational knowledge of these technologies.
